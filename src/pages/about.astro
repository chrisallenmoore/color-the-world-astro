          Color the World is an independent publication launched in May 2022.
          We're a family-friendly place on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not include any images from other sites on our webpages.
          Instead, if we find a coloring page or other ideas that we like, we
          recreate those works (sometimes with little or many changes). Either
          way, we end up with better quality and get to practice our art skills.
          All the recreations are available for free.
        </p>
        <p>We also create original works and note them as such.</p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to share the very best coloring pages to bring happiness
          and joy to others.
