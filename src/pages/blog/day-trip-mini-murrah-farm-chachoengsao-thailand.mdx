We had a great day at Mini Murrah Farm and think you would, too!

From activities like churning ice cream, curing salted eggs to making soap. Lula and Doyle share their fun experiences they had recently at Mini Murrah Farm in Chacoengsao, Thailand.

The food and drinks were all fantastic, the train ride was fun, and the animals were super happy and friendly. We really enjoyed all that Mini Murrah Farm has to offer. It was a great family outing.
