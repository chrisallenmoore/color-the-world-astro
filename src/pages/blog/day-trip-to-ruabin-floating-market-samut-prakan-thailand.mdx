Thailand has a lot of great places to go with lots of things to do and see. Markets are some of our favorite places to go.

We love to take trips! Lula and Doyle show you the fun you and your family can have at Ruabin Floating Market, Samut Prakan, Thailand. We checked it out on a recent day trip and now it's your turn!
